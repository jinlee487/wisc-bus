# INTRO

- CS 638: Data Science in the City of Madison will involve writing Python code to analyze and visualize data sets about the City of Madison, WI. The goal will be to arrive at actionable suggestions. In 2012, the city adopted an open-data policy; projects will analyze data that is released under this policy (http://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/) and possibly other data that city collaborators may provide for this course. Project teams will create data visualizations and present them to the class on a weekly basis. Teams will choose their projects and set their own research agenda.
